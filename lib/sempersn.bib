 abstract = {In this paper the problem of optimization of the measurement matrix in compressive (also called compressed) sensing framework is addressed. In compressed sensing a measurement matrix that has a small coherence with the sparsifying dictionary (or basis) is of interest. Random measurement matrices have been used so far since they present small coherence with almost any sparsifying dictionary. However, it has been recently shown that optimizing the measurement matrix toward decreasing the coherence is possible and can improve the performance. Based on this conclusion, we propose here an alternating minimization approach for this purpose which is a variant of Grassmannian frame design modified by a gradient-based technique. The objective is to optimize an initially random measurement matrix to a matrix which presents a smaller coherence than the initial one. We established several experiments to measure the performance of the proposed method and compare it with those of the existing approaches. The results are encouraging and indicate improved reconstruction quality, when utilizing the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Compressive sampling offers a new paradigm for acquiring signals that are compressible with respect to an orthonormal basis. The major algorithmic challenge in compressive sampling is to approximate a compressible signal from noisy samples. This paper describes a new iterative recovery algorithm called CoSaMP that delivers the same guarantees as the best optimization-based approaches. Moreover, this algorithm offers rigorous bounds on computational cost and storage. It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems because it requires only matrix{\textendash}vector multiplies with the sampling matrix. For compressible signals, the running time is just O(Nlog2N), where N is the length of the signal.},

 abstract = {Abstract We consider linear inverse problems where the solution is assumed to have a sparse expansion on an arbitrary preassigned orthonormal basis. We prove that replacing the usual quadratic regularizing penalties by weighted p-penalties on the coefficients of such expansions, with 1 p 2, still regularizes the problem. Use of such p-penalized problems with p 2 is often advocated when one expects the underlying ideal noiseless solution to have a sparse expansion with respect to the basis under consideration. To compute the corresponding regularized solutions, we analyze an iterative algorithm that amounts to a Landweber iteration with thresholding (or nonlinear shrinkage) applied at each iteration step. We prove that this algorithm converges in norm. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

By contrast, single-pixel cameras use a sequence of mask patterns to filter the scene along with the corresponding measurements of the transmitted intensity which is recorded using a single-pixel detector. This review considers the development of single-pixel cameras from the seminal work of Duarte et al. up to the present state of the art. We cover the variety of hardware configurations, design of mask patterns and the associated reconstruction algorithms, many of which relate to the field of compressed sensing and, more recently, machine learning. Overall, single-pixel cameras lend themselves to imaging at non-visible wavelengths and with precise timing or depth resolution. We discuss the suitability of single-pixel cameras for different application areas, including infrared imaging and 3D situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.},

 abstract = {Given a dictionary D = \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}{\textbackslash}\{dk\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}{\textbackslash}\} of vectors dk, we seek to represent a signal S as a linear combination S = \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}sum{\textbackslash}\}k \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}gamma{\textbackslash}\}(k)dk, with scalar coefficients \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}gamma{\textbackslash}\}(k). In particular, we aim for the sparsest representation possible. In general, this requires a combinatorial optimization process. Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the l1 norm of the coefficients \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}gamma{\textbackslash}\}̱. In this article, we obtain parallel results in a more general setting, where the dictionary D can arise from two or several bases, frames, or even less structured systems. We sketch three applications: separating linear features from planar ones in 3D data, noncooperative multiuser encoding, and identification of over-complete independent component models.},

Based on the premise that data acquisition and compression can be performed simultaneously, compressive sensing finds applications in imaging, signal processing, and many other domains. In the areas of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and theoretical computer science, an explosion of research activity has already followed the theoretical results that highlighted the efficiency of the basic principles. The elegant ideas behind these principles are also of independent interest to pure mathematicians. A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing gives a detailed account of the core theory upon which the field is built.},

ABSTRACT
Existing deep neural network (DNN) frameworks optimize the computation graph of a DNN by applying graph transformations manually designed by human experts. This approach misses possible graph optimizations and is difficult to scale, as new DNN operators are introduced on a regular basis.

We propose TASO, the first DNN computation graph optimizer that automatically generates graph substitutions. TASO takes as input a list of operator specifications and generates candidate substitutions using the given operators as basic building blocks. All generated substitutions are formally verified against the operator specifications using an automated theorem prover. To optimize a given DNN computation graph, TASO performs a cost-based backtracking search, applying the substitutions to find an optimized graph, which can be directly used by existing DNN frameworks.

Our evaluation on five real-world DNN architectures shows that TASO outperforms existing DNN frameworks by up to 2.8X, while requiring significantly less human effort. For example, TensorFlow currently contains approximately 53,000 lines of manual optimization rules, while the operator specifications needed by TASO are only 1,400 lines of code.

  abstract  = {The validation and deployment of novel research ideas in the field of Deep Learning is often limited by the availability of efficient compute kernels for certain basic primitives. In particular, operations that cannot leverage existing vendor libraries (e.g., cuBLAS, cuDNN) are at risk of facing poor device utilization unless custom implementations are written by experts – usually at the expense of portability. For this reason, the development of new programming abstractions for specifying custom Deep Learning workloads at a minimal performance cost has become crucial. We present Triton, a language and compiler centered around the concept of tile, i.e., statically shaped multi-dimensional sub-arrays. Our approach revolves around (1) a C-based language and an LLVM-based intermediate representation (IR) for expressing tensor programs in terms of operations on parametric tile variables and (2) a set of novel tile-level optimization passes for compiling these programs into efficient GPU code. We demonstrate how Triton can be used to build portable implementations of matrix multiplication and convolution kernels on par with hand-tuned vendor libraries (cuBLAS / cuDNN), or for efficiently implementing recent research ideas such as shift convolutions.},

 abstract = {A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n {\texttimes} n kernel matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m {\textquotedblleft}inducing points{\textquotedblright}. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m) for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables approximate inference for very large data sets; however, the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation for extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m compact basis functions. For a fixed grid, our new method scales to truly massive data sets: after the initial linear time pass, all subsequent computations are independent of n. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and for all the main GP inference tasks. With per-iteration complexity independent of the dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over 100 million points.},

In this paper, we consider the training of NNs with discrete-valued weights and sign activation functions that can be implemented more efficiently in terms of inference speed, memory requirements, and power consumption. We build on the framework of probabilistic forward propagations using the local reparameterization trick, where instead of training a single set of NN weights we rather train a distribution over these weights. Using this approach, we can perform gradient-based learning by optimizing the continuous distribution parameters over discrete weights while at the same time perform backpropagation through the sign activation. In our experiments, we investigate the influence of the number of weights on the classification performance on several benchmark datasets, and we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},

The basis functions are orthogonal in H2, and generalize the pulse, Laguerre and Kautz bases. One of their important properties is that, when chosen properly, they can substantially increase the speed of convergence of the series expansion. This leads to accurate approximate models with only a few coefficients to be estimated. Explicit bounds are derived for the bias and variance errors that occur in parameter estimates as well as in the resulting transfer function estimates.}

abstract="We introduce a convex optimization modeling framework that transforms a convex optimization problem expressed in a form natural and convenient for the user into an equivalent cone program in a way that preserves fast linear transforms in the original problem. By representing linear functions in the transformation process not as matrices, but as graphs that encode composition of linear operators, we arrive at a matrix-free cone program, i.e., one whose data matrix is represented by a linear operator and its adjoint. This cone program can then be solved by a matrix-free cone solver. By combining the matrix-free modeling framework and cone solver, we obtain a general method for efficiently solving convex optimization problems involving fast linear transforms.",

 abstract = {Discover New Methods for Dealing with High-Dimensional Data A sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data. Top experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of 1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso. In this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.},

In this contribution we propose an efficient representation of the polarimetric antenna response, which we refer to as the Effective Anerture Distribution Function (EADF. high-resolution parameter estimation are applications in which This reduced description permits us to efficiently interpolate thebeam pattem to gather the antenna response For an arbitrary direction in azimuth and elevation. Moreover, the EADF provides a continuous description of the array manifold and its derivatives with respect to azimuth and elevation. The latter is valuable for the performance evaluation of an antenna array as well as for gradient-based parameter estimation techniques.},

  abstract  = {Millimeter-wave wireless systems are emerging as a promising technology for meeting the exploding capacity requirements of wireless communication networks. Besides large bandwidths, small wavelengths at mm-wave lead to a high-dimensional spatial signal space that can be exploited for significant capacity gains through high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. In conventional MIMO approaches, optimal performance requires prohibitively high transceiver complexity. By combining the concept of beamspace MIMO communication with a hybrid analog-digital transceiver, continuous aperture phased (CAP) MIMO achieves near-optimal performance with dramatically lower complexity. This paper presents a framework for physically-accurate computational modeling and analysis of CAP-MIMO, and reports measurement results on a DLA-based prototype for multimode line-of-sight communication. The model, based on a critically sampled system representation, is used to demonstrate the performance gains of CAP-MIMO over state-of-the-art designs at mm-wave. For example, a CAP-MIMO system can achieve a spectral efficiency of 10-20 bits/s/Hz with a 17-31 dB power advantage over state-of-the-art, corresponding to a data rate of 10-200 Gbps with 1-10 GHz system bandwidth. The model is refined to analyze critical sources of power loss in an actual multimode system. The prototype-based measurement results closely follow the theoretical predictions, validating CAP-MIMO theory, and illustrating the utility of the model.},

 abstractnote = {The development and capabilities of synthetic aperture focusing techniques for ultrasonic testing (SAFT-UT) are presented. The purpose of SAFT-UT is to produce high-resolution images of the interior of opaque objects. The goal of this work is to develop and implement methods which can be used to detect and to quantify the extent of defects and cracks in critical components of nuclear reactors (pressure vessels, primary piping systems, and nozzles). This report places particular emphasis upon the practical experimental results that have been obtained using SAFT-UT as well as the theoretical background that underlies synthetic aperture focusing. A discussion regarding high-speed and real-time implementations of two- and three-dimensional synthetic aperture focusing is also presented.},

We then derive such reconstruction guarantees for two relevant scenarios, one where the matrices are unstructured and one where they have to be Khatri-Rao products. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed method can be implemented with a physically motivated numerical optimization scheme, and how it compares to a conventional scheme of random compression matrices.},

The book assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. A novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language. FEATURES: All examples have been tested, which is in machine-readable form. It discusses various aspects of C in more detail, although the emphasis is on examples of complete programs, rather than isolated fragments. It deals with basic data types, operators and expressions. Covers functions and program structure, external variables, scope rules, multiple source files, and also touches on the preprocessor. It also describes an interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system, concentrating on input/output, the file system, and storage allocation. It also provides a language reference manual. The official statement of the syntax and semantics of C is the ANSI standard.},

 abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB{\texttrademark}, Mathematica{\texttrademark}, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},

 abstract = {We present a novel Python package for the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of computational models. The mathematical background is based on the non-intrusive generalized polynomial chaos method allowing one to treat the investigated models as black box systems, without interfering with their legacy code. Pygpc is optimized to analyze models with complex and possibly discontinuous transfer functions that are computationally costly to evaluate. The toolbox determines the uncertainty of multiple quantities of interest in parallel, given the uncertainties of the system parameters and inputs. It also yields gradient-based sensitivity measures and Sobol indices to reveal the relative importance of model parameters.},
