 abstract = {In this paper the problem of optimization of the measurement matrix in compressive (also called compressed) sensing framework is addressed. In compressed sensing a measurement matrix that has a small coherence with the sparsifying dictionary (or basis) is of interest. Random measurement matrices have been used so far since they present small coherence with almost any sparsifying dictionary. However, it has been recently shown that optimizing the measurement matrix toward decreasing the coherence is possible and can improve the performance. Based on this conclusion, we propose here an alternating minimization approach for this purpose which is a variant of Grassmannian frame design modified by a gradient-based technique. The objective is to optimize an initially random measurement matrix to a matrix which presents a smaller coherence than the initial one. We established several experiments to measure the performance of the proposed method and compare it with those of the existing approaches. The results are encouraging and indicate improved reconstruction quality, when utilizing the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Compressive sampling offers a new paradigm for acquiring signals that are compressible with respect to an orthonormal basis. The major algorithmic challenge in compressive sampling is to approximate a compressible signal from noisy samples. This paper describes a new iterative recovery algorithm called CoSaMP that delivers the same guarantees as the best optimization-based approaches. Moreover, this algorithm offers rigorous bounds on computational cost and storage. It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems because it requires only matrix{\textendash}vector multiplies with the sampling matrix. For compressible signals, the running time is just O(Nlog2N), where N is the length of the signal.},

 abstract = {Abstract We consider linear inverse problems where the solution is assumed to have a sparse expansion on an arbitrary preassigned orthonormal basis. We prove that replacing the usual quadratic regularizing penalties by weighted p-penalties on the coefficients of such expansions, with 1 p 2, still regularizes the problem. Use of such p-penalized problems with p 2 is often advocated when one expects the underlying ideal noiseless solution to have a sparse expansion with respect to the basis under consideration. To compute the corresponding regularized solutions, we analyze an iterative algorithm that amounts to a Landweber iteration with thresholding (or nonlinear shrinkage) applied at each iteration step. We prove that this algorithm converges in norm. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

By contrast, single-pixel cameras use a sequence of mask patterns to filter the scene along with the corresponding measurements of the transmitted intensity which is recorded using a single-pixel detector. This review considers the development of single-pixel cameras from the seminal work of Duarte et al. up to the present state of the art. We cover the variety of hardware configurations, design of mask patterns and the associated reconstruction algorithms, many of which relate to the field of compressed sensing and, more recently, machine learning. Overall, single-pixel cameras lend themselves to imaging at non-visible wavelengths and with precise timing or depth resolution. We discuss the suitability of single-pixel cameras for different application areas, including infrared imaging and 3D situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.},

 abstract = {Given a dictionary D = \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}{\textbackslash}\{dk\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}{\textbackslash}\} of vectors dk, we seek to represent a signal S as a linear combination S = \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}sum{\textbackslash}\}k \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}gamma{\textbackslash}\}(k)dk, with scalar coefficients \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}gamma{\textbackslash}\}(k). In particular, we aim for the sparsest representation possible. In general, this requires a combinatorial optimization process. Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the l1 norm of the coefficients \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ensuremath{\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}gamma{\textbackslash}\}̱. In this article, we obtain parallel results in a more general setting, where the dictionary D can arise from two or several bases, frames, or even less structured systems. We sketch three applications: separating linear features from planar ones in 3D data, noncooperative multiuser encoding, and identification of over-complete independent component models.},

Based on the premise that data acquisition and compression can be performed simultaneously, compressive sensing finds applications in imaging, signal processing, and many other domains. In the areas of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and theoretical computer science, an explosion of research activity has already followed the theoretical results that highlighted the efficiency of the basic principles. The elegant ideas behind these principles are also of independent interest to pure mathematicians. A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing gives a detailed account of the core theory upon which the field is built.},

ABSTRACT
Existing deep neural network (DNN) frameworks optimize the computation graph of a DNN by applying graph transformations manually designed by human experts. This approach misses possible graph optimizations and is difficult to scale, as new DNN operators are introduced on a regular basis.

We propose TASO, the first DNN computation graph optimizer that automatically generates graph substitutions. TASO takes as input a list of operator specifications and generates candidate substitutions using the given operators as basic building blocks. All generated substitutions are formally verified against the operator specifications using an automated theorem prover. To optimize a given DNN computation graph, TASO performs a cost-based backtracking search, applying the substitutions to find an optimized graph, which can be directly used by existing DNN frameworks.

Our evaluation on five real-world DNN architectures shows that TASO outperforms existing DNN frameworks by up to 2.8X, while requiring significantly less human effort. For example, TensorFlow currently contains approximately 53,000 lines of manual optimization rules, while the operator specifications needed by TASO are only 1,400 lines of code.

  abstract  = {The validation and deployment of novel research ideas in the field of Deep Learning is often limited by the availability of efficient compute kernels for certain basic primitives. In particular, operations that cannot leverage existing vendor libraries (e.g., cuBLAS, cuDNN) are at risk of facing poor device utilization unless custom implementations are written by experts – usually at the expense of portability. For this reason, the development of new programming abstractions for specifying custom Deep Learning workloads at a minimal performance cost has become crucial. We present Triton, a language and compiler centered around the concept of tile, i.e., statically shaped multi-dimensional sub-arrays. Our approach revolves around (1) a C-based language and an LLVM-based intermediate representation (IR) for expressing tensor programs in terms of operations on parametric tile variables and (2) a set of novel tile-level optimization passes for compiling these programs into efficient GPU code. We demonstrate how Triton can be used to build portable implementations of matrix multiplication and convolution kernels on par with hand-tuned vendor libraries (cuBLAS / cuDNN), or for efficiently implementing recent research ideas such as shift convolutions.},

 abstract = {A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n {\texttimes} n kernel matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m {\textquotedblleft}inducing points{\textquotedblright}. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m) for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables approximate inference for very large data sets; however, the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation for extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m compact basis functions. For a fixed grid, our new method scales to truly massive data sets: after the initial linear time pass, all subsequent computations are independent of n. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and for all the main GP inference tasks. With per-iteration complexity independent of the dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over 100 million points.},

In this paper, we consider the training of NNs with discrete-valued weights and sign activation functions that can be implemented more efficiently in terms of inference speed, memory requirements, and power consumption. We build on the framework of probabilistic forward propagations using the local reparameterization trick, where instead of training a single set of NN weights we rather train a distribution over these weights. Using this approach, we can perform gradient-based learning by optimizing the continuous distribution parameters over discrete weights while at the same time perform backpropagation through the sign activation. In our experiments, we investigate the influence of the number of weights on the classification performance on several benchmark datasets, and we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},

The basis functions are orthogonal in H2, and generalize the pulse, Laguerre and Kautz bases. One of their important properties is that, when chosen properly, they can substantially increase the speed of convergence of the series expansion. This leads to accurate approximate models with only a few coefficients to be estimated. Explicit bounds are derived for the bias and variance errors that occur in parameter estimates as well as in the resulting transfer function estimates.}

abstract="We introduce a convex optimization modeling framework that transforms a convex optimization problem expressed in a form natural and convenient for the user into an equivalent cone program in a way that preserves fast linear transforms in the original problem. By representing linear functions in the transformation process not as matrices, but as graphs that encode composition of linear operators, we arrive at a matrix-free cone program, i.e., one whose data matrix is represented by a linear operator and its adjoint. This cone program can then be solved by a matrix-free cone solver. By combining the matrix-free modeling framework and cone solver, we obtain a general method for efficiently solving convex optimization problems involving fast linear transforms.",

 abstract = {Model selection is of fundamental importance to high dimensional modelling featured in many contemporary applications. Classical principles of model selection include the Bayesian principle and the Kullback–Leibler divergence principle, which lead to the Bayesian information criterion and Akaike information criterion respectively, when models are correctly specified. Yet model misspecification is unavoidable in practice. We derive novel asymptotic expansions of the two well-known principles in misspecified generalized linear models, which give the generalized Bayesian information criterion and generalized Akaike information criterion. A specific form of prior probabilities motivated by the Kullback–Leibler divergence principle leads to the generalized Bayesian information criterion with prior probability, GBICp, which can be naturally decomposed as the sum of the negative maximum quasi-log-likelihood, a penalty on model dimensionality, and a penalty on model misspecification directly. Numerical studies demonstrate the advantage of the new methods for model selection in both correctly specified and misspecified models.},

 abstract = {Discover New Methods for Dealing with High-Dimensional Data A sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data. Top experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of 1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso. In this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.},

  abstract  = {Estimating the parameters of a geometric propagation model from MIMO channel sounding measurements will be considered, which requires the solution of an inverse problem. Thus, a model of the measured data is derived, which incorporates a model of the measurement system as well as the parameters of interest. Based on the data model a maximum-likelihood estimator will be derived to infer the model parameters. Because virtual antenna arrays are considerer, formed by step-wise rotating directive antennas at transmitter and receiver side, the MIMO measurements are conducted in the beam-space. Hence, the data model can be described by a multidimensional convolution of the measurement system and the propagation channel. Based on the convolutional modelling, the parameter estimation problem is transformed into a harmonic retrieval problem, which can be solved by an Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT algorithm. The maximum-likelihood and ESPRIT estimator are compared by Monte-Carlo simulations according to their root-mean-square estimation error.},

  abstract  = {Estimating the parameters of a geometric propagation model from MIMO channel sounding measurements will be considered, which requires the solution of an inverse problem. Thus, a model of the measured data is derived, which incorporates a model of the measurement system as well as the parameters of interest. Based on the data model a maximum-likelihood estimator will be derived to infer the model parameters. Because virtual antenna arrays are considerer, formed by step-wise rotating directive antennas at transmitter and receiver side, the MIMO measurements are conducted in the beam-space. Hence, the data model can be described by a multidimensional convolution of the measurement system and the propagation channel. Based on the convolutional modelling, the parameter estimation problem is transformed into a harmonic retrieval problem, which can be solved by an Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT algorithm. The maximum-likelihood and ESPRIT estimator are compared by Monte-Carlo simulations according to their root-mean-square estimation error.},

  abstract  = {Millimeter-wave wireless systems are emerging as a promising technology for meeting the exploding capacity requirements of wireless communication networks. Besides large bandwidths, small wavelengths at mm-wave lead to a high-dimensional spatial signal space that can be exploited for significant capacity gains through high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. In conventional MIMO approaches, optimal performance requires prohibitively high transceiver complexity. By combining the concept of beamspace MIMO communication with a hybrid analog-digital transceiver, continuous aperture phased (CAP) MIMO achieves near-optimal performance with dramatically lower complexity. This paper presents a framework for physically-accurate computational modeling and analysis of CAP-MIMO, and reports measurement results on a DLA-based prototype for multimode line-of-sight communication. The model, based on a critically sampled system representation, is used to demonstrate the performance gains of CAP-MIMO over state-of-the-art designs at mm-wave. For example, a CAP-MIMO system can achieve a spectral efficiency of 10-20 bits/s/Hz with a 17-31 dB power advantage over state-of-the-art, corresponding to a data rate of 10-200 Gbps with 1-10 GHz system bandwidth. The model is refined to analyze critical sources of power loss in an actual multimode system. The prototype-based measurement results closely follow the theoretical predictions, validating CAP-MIMO theory, and illustrating the utility of the model.},

  abstract  = {A novel approach for model-based interpolation of sampled antenna pattern in azimuth, elevation and frequency domain is presented. Using wavefield modelling, an algebraic antenna model is derived, which incorporates Fourier transformation and is stated as Effective Time-Aperture Distribution Function (ETADF). A method to automatically de-noise sampled antenna pattern by estimating the model order is proposed. Furthermore, numerically efficient interpolation of antenna pattern data from the ETADF is presented. The ETADF approach is validated on simulation data of a conical horn antenna.},

The goal of this work is to develop and implement methods which can be used to detect and to quantify the extent of defects and cracks in critical components of nuclear reactors (pressure vessels, primary piping systems, and nozzles). This report places particular emphasis upon the practical experimental results that have been obtained using SAFT-UT as well as the theoretical background that underlies synthetic aperture focusing. A discussion regarding high-speed and real-time implementations of two- and three-dimensional synthetic aperture focusing is also presented.},

  abstract = {We have developed a real-time 141 GHz joint communications and sensing (JCAS) channel sounder, with focus on this article on 3-D near-field imaging (less than 50 cm range) for applications such as finger recognition. To achieve this, we integrated phased-array antennas into the channel sounder—to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so in the D-band—and adapted the switched beamforming technique we developed previously, to realize real-time near-field beamforming. We also propose another novel technique, coined carrier multiplexing, to extend the instantaneous bandwidth of the phased arrays to their full radio frequency (RF) passband—by a factor of two for our current arrays and by a factor of ten for our next edition. Finally, we integrated camera and Lidar systems that are temporally and spatially synchronized with the channel sounder to generate real-time digital twins of the target while sounding, enabling machine learning on multimodal data. We showcase system performance with controlled experiments on metal cylinders, demonstrating imaging resolution on the order of a centimeter.}

  abstract = {The recent advances in Integrated Sensing and Communications (ICAS) essentially transform mobile radio networks into a diverse, dynamic and heterogeneous sensing network. For the application of localization, the acquired sensing data needs to be processed to estimates of the state vectors of the targets in a timely manner. This paper aims at providing a roadmap for the development of a suitable computing system for ICAS. We propose to embed the signal processing into the concept of edge computing. It provides the necessary theoretical computing framework, since it alleviates the need for communication with a remote cloud. To obtain localization information in such a distributed, asynchronous and heterogeneous scenario, we study how existing maximum likelihood estimation techniques can be transformed into algorithms that can be orchestrated close to the edge. The advantage of these approaches is that they have well studied statistical properties and efficient algorithmic implementations exist. We propose to study how to derive a graph that encodes these algorithms' processing by relating individual and isolated computations in terms of the input/output-behavior of so-called compute nodes. This compute graph structure can then be flexibly distributed across multiple devices and even whole processing/sensing units. Moreover, modern computing architectures leverage such graph structures to optimize the efficient use of computing hardware. Additionally, once this graph is constructed we have laid the groundwork for the possibility to exchange certain compute steps by deep learning architectures.  For instance, this allows to sidestep some costly iterative part of traditional maximum likelihood estimators, which further contributes to the low-latency of the localization task.  Moreover, deep learning methods bear the promise of being more robust to model mismatches in contrast to the conventional model based approaches. As a consequence, we can then study the relation between those classical methods and the new deep learning based methods and analyze the achievable performance. One key final result will be a deeper understanding of how well the maximum likelihood approach can be applied to ICAS and how much it profits from the combination with modern deep learning techniques.},

Accurately localizing the target and tracking the target’s movement are critical for numerous smart Internet of Things (IoT) systems (smart manufacturing, smart transportation, etc.). This paper aims to realize super-resolution localization and tracking in WiFi sensing by leveraging the IEEE 802.11ad beamforming training procedure. We leverage the CLEAN-Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (CLEAN-SAGE) algorithm on a single beam sweeping cycle for target localization and investigate the targets’ delays and angle estimation. For tracking moving targets, we design mechanisms to estimate the target’s motion, including the target’s velocity and motion pattern, such as estimating the target’s spatial positions over time to obtain the Doppler shift or tracking its trajectory using a Kalman filter. In order to prove that our approach works effectively, we conduct a thorough performance evaluation study. Our evaluation results confirm that the CLEAN-SAGE algorithm can achieve estimation performance beyond the ISAC system’s inherent bandwidth and beamwidth constraints. Furthermore, we provide insights into how system configurations, including antenna size, beam overlap, and the number of iterations in the SAGE algorithm, influence its performance.},

  abstract={The analysis of wireless communication channels at the mmWave, sub-THz and THz bands gives rise to difficulties in the construction of antenna arrays due to the small maximum inter-element spacing constraints at these frequencies. Arrays with uniform spacing greater than half the wavelength for a certain carrier frequency exhibit aliasing side-lobes in the angular domain, prohibiting non-ambiguous estimates of a propagating wave-front’s angle of arrival.In this paper, we present how wide-band modelling of the array response is useful in mitigating this spatial aliasing effect. This approach aims to reduce the grating lobes by exploiting the angle- and frequency-dependent phase-shifts observed in the response of the array to a planar wave-front travelling across it. Furthermore, we propose a method by which the spatial correlation characteristics of an array operating at 33 GHz carrier frequency with an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz can be improved such that the angular-domain side-lobes are reduced by 5-10 dB. This method, applicable to arbitrary antenna array manifolds, makes use of a linear operator that is applied to the base-band samples of the channel transfer function measured in space and frequency domains. By means of synthetically simulated arrays, we show that when operating with a bandwidth of 1 GHz, the use of a derived linear operator applied to the array output results in the spatial correlation characteristics approaching those of the array operating at a bandwidth of 12 GHz. Hence, non-ambiguous angle estimates can be obtained in the field without the use of expensive high-bandwidth RF front-end components.},

We use these quantities to design waveforms that improve range estimation. In practice, evaluating the Fisher information requires prior knowledge of the propagation scenario which is usually unavailable. Hence, we propose two solutions which we compare numerically to the classical approach of equal power distribution. The evaluation shows that an optimized power distribution can improve the CRB comparable up to a 4 dB gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) if knowledge about the propagation scenario is available and slightly less if the scenario is unknown.},

  abstract={Switched phased array systems operating at high sample rates generate large amounts of data during measurements of radio channels, but many scenarios contain only few multipath components. Compressed Sensing suggests in these cases Nyquist-rate samples are wasteful in terms of data size. It has been observed that structural parameters, i.e., time of flight and angle of arrival, of the propagation paths are temporally consistent, as they vary slowly in time. Hence, we propose a local temporally consistent signal model that includes delay and angle of arrival, and also their time-derivatives, coherently connecting multiple radio channel snapshots. This allows to use a cyclic compression scheme consisting of a few compression matrices that extract mutually incoherent information from adjacent snapshots. Last, we present an algorithm to extract specular multipath components from these compressive measurements.We verify our findings on simulated data and real measurements. On simulated data we observe a good agreement of the estimates with the available ground-truth and show that the proposed cyclic compression scheme improves estimation accuracy. On measured data, we compare the estimates from data obtained at Nyquist rate to data compressed to 17\% of the original size and find good agreement as well.},

  abstract={Estimating the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), is a simple yet reliable technique to accurately perform an indoor monostatic localization. To implement TDoA estimation, one approach is to utilize a broadband radar system equipped with multiple receiving antenna elements. To obtain the Time of Arrival (ToA) at each antenna element, the round-trip time is required. However, the round-trip time does not only consist of the propagation delay in free space but the propagation delay within the antenna as well. To perform the localization precisely, it is desired that an antenna element introduces a uniform delay in all directions. To this end, a compact rectangular dielectric resonator antenna is designed for the operating frequency of 6.5 GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 20\%. Al2O3 with a dielectric constant of 9.8 is used for the substrate as well as the dielectric resonator. The antenna is designed to provide a high correlation between the input and the output pulses. To investigate the correlation, the antenna is excited with a modulated Gaussian pulse and the radiated pulses are studied. The antenna possesses an excellent behavior in terms of pulse preservation for the upper hemisphere. Therefore, when incoming pulses from the same distance but different directions impinge on the antenna, they reach the port of the antenna at a similar time. It is shown that this feature of the proposed antenna allows the utilization of TDoA estimation without the need for a calibration step. The characteristics of the antenna are verified by simulation and measurement.},

  abstract={A framework is proposed for developing and evaluating algorithms for extracting multipath propagation components (MPCs) from measurements collected by channel sounders at millimeter-wave frequencies. Sounders equipped with an omni-directional transmitter and a receiver with a uniform planar array (UPA) are considered. An accurate mathematical model is developed for the spatial frequency response of the sounder that incorporates the non-ideal cross-polar beampatterns for the UPA elements. Due to the limited Field-of-View (FoV) of each element, the model is extended to accommodate multi-FoV measurements in distinct azimuth directions. A beamspace representation of the spatial frequency response is leveraged to develop three progressively complex algorithms aimed at solving the single-snapshot maximum likelihood estimation problem: greedy matching pursuit (CLEAN), space-alternative generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE), and RiMAX. The first two are based on purely specular MPCs whereas RiMAX also accommodates diffuse MPCs. Two approaches for performance evaluation are proposed, one with knowledge of ground truth parameters, and one based on reconstruction mean-squared error. The three algorithms are compared through a demanding channel model with hundreds of MPCs and through real measurements. The results demonstrate that CLEAN gives quite reasonable estimates which are improved by SAGE and RiMAX. Lessons learned and directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract={To efficiently extract estimates about the propagation behavior of electromagnetic waves in a radio environment it is common to invoke the narrowband-assumption. It essentially states that the relative bandwidth of the measurement system is so low that the frequency response of a single propagation path only depends on it Time-of-Flight and the response of the measurement device can be calibrated independently of the measured channel. Recent advances into higher relative bandwidths and antenna arrays with larger spatial aperture render this assumption less likely to be satisfied, which leads to a model mismatch during estimation. In this case estimates are inherently biased and have a special statistical behavior. This behavior can be captured by the so-called Misspecified Cramér-Rao Bound, which formulates a lower bound for the variance of estimates that are biased due to model mismatch. We analyze this bound in contrast to the traditional Cramér-Rao Bound and show the shortcomings in the setting of joint ToF-DoA estimation in the mmWave spectrum. The conducted numerical studies also show that planar array geometries inherently suffer from violation of the narrowband assumption irrespective of the individual elements' frequency response, whereas circular structures show it to a lesser degree.},

  abstract={Multidimensional channel sounding measures the geometrical structure of mobile radio propagation. The parameters of a multipath data model in terms of directions, time-of-flight, and Doppler shift are estimated from observations in frequency, time, and space. A maximum likelihood estimation framework allows joint high resolution in all dimensions. The prerequisite for this is an appropriate parametric data model that represents the multipath propagation correctly. At the same time, a device data model is necessary that typically results from calibration measurements. The used model should be as simple as possible, since its structure has a considerable effect on the estimation effort. For instance, the inherent effort in parameter search is reduced if the influence of the parameters is kept independent. Therefore, the data model is characterized by several approximations. The most important is the “narrowband assumption,” which assumes a low relative bandwidth and also avoids considering any frequency response in magnitude and phase. We extend the well-known multidimensional Richter maximization approach (RIMAX) parameter estimation framework by including proper frequency responses. The advantage reveals itself with high bandwidth in the mmWave and sub-THz range. It allows for a more realistic modeling of antenna arrays, and it breaks with the usual narrowband model and allows a better modeling of mutual coupling and time delay effects. If the interacting object extends over several delay bins (hence, an extended target in radar terminology), we propose a model that assigns a short delay spread and a frequency response to the propagation path that associates it with the respective object. We verify the validity of the device model by numerical experiments on simulated and measured antenna data and compare it with RIMAX. In addition, we use synthetic data based on ray-tracing results and measurements both ranging from 27.0 to 33GHz with known ground-truth information and show that the proposed estimator delivers better performance for higher relative bandwidths than the conventional RIMAX implementation.},

The target responses are estimated jointly with the global target parameters range and velocity. The large relative bandwidth of UWB has consequences for model-based parameter estimation. On the one hand, the Doppler effect leads to a dispersive response in the Doppler spectrum and to a coupling of the target parameters that both need to be considered during modeling and estimation. On the other hand, the shape of an extended target results in a dispersive response in range, which can be resolved by the radar resolution. We consider this extended response as a parameter of interest, e.g., for the purpose of target recognition. Hence, we propose an efficient description and estimation of it by a finite impulse response (FIR) structure only imposing a restriction on the target’s dispersiveness in range. We evaluate the approach on simulations, compare it to state-of-the-art solutions, and provide a validation of the FIR model on measurements of a static scenario.},

While the sparsity order can be directly inferred from the effective rank of the observation matrix in the multiple snapshot case, this appears to be impossible in the more challenging single snapshot case. It is shown that specially designed measurement matrices allow to rearrange the measurement vector into a matrix such that its effective rank coincides with the effective sparsity order. In fact, it is proven that matrices that are composed of a Khatri-Rao product of smaller matrices generate measurements that allow to infer the sparsity order. Moreover, if some samples are used more than once, one of the matrices needs to be Vandermonde. These structural constraints reduce the degrees of freedom in choosing the measurement matrix, which may incur in a degradation in the achievable coherence. Thus, this paper also addresses suitable choices of the measurement matrices. In particular, Khatri-Rao and Vandermonde matrices are analyzed in terms of their coherence and a new design for Vandermonde matrices that achieves a low coherence is proposed.},

This experiment produces a fixed number of multipath components with traceable propagation properties in the different domains that can be used to test resolution and performance. Because of the inherent characteristics of the measurement hardware, we have introduced an adaptation on a parametric high resolution estimation algorithm to account the imperfections of the channel sounder. The results have shown to account for a relative good performance of the sounder and the tested parametric and non-parametric estimation algorithms.},

  abstract = {Scientific computing requires handling large linear models, which are often composed of structured matrices. With increasing model size, dense representations quickly become infeasible to compute or store. Matrix-free implementations are suited to mitigate this problem at the expense of additional implementation overhead, which complicates research and development effort by months, when applied to practical research problems. Fastmat is a framework for handling large structured matrices by offering an easy-to-use abstraction model. It allows for the expression of matrix-free linear operators in a mathematically intuitive way, while retaining their benefits in computation performance and memory efficiency. A built-in hierarchical unit-test system boosts debugging productivity and run-time execution path optimization improves the performance of highly-structured operators. The architecture is completed with an interface for abstractly describing algorithms that apply such matrix-free linear operators, while maintaining clear separation of their respective implementation levels. Fastmat achieves establishing a close relationship between implementation code and the actual mathematical notation of a given problem, promoting readable, portable and re-usable scientific code.},

  abstract = {We propose a compact hardware architecture for measuring sparse channel impulse responses (IR) by extending the M-Sequence ultra-wideband (UWB) measurement principle with the concept of compressed sensing. A channel is excited with a periodic M-sequence and its response signal is observed using a Random Demodulator (RD), which observes pseudo-random linear combinations of the response signal at a rate significantly lower than the measurement bandwidth. The excitation signal and the RD mixing signal are generated from compactly implementable Linear Feedback Shift registers (LFSR) and operated from a common clock. A linear model is derived that allows retrieving an IR from a set of observations using Sparse-Signal-Recovery (SSR). A Matrix-free model implementation is possible due to the choice of synchronous LFSRs as signal generators, resulting in low computational complexity. For validation, real measurement data of a time-variant channel containing multipath components is processed by simulation models of our proposed architecture and the classic M-Sequence method. We show successful IR recovery using our architecture and SSR, outperforming the classic method significantly in terms of IR measurement rate. Compared to the classic method, the proposed architecture allows faster measurements of sparse time-varying channels, resulting in higher Doppler tolerance without increasing hardware or data stream complexity.},

The novelty of our approach is in the algorithms initialization using a deep learning architecture. Currently, available approaches can only deal with scenarios where a single mode is present. However, in measurements, two or more modes are often observed. This much more challenging multi-modal setting bears two important questions: How many modes are there, and how can we estimate those? To this end, we propose a Neural Net-architecture that can reliably estimate the number of modes present in the data and also provide an initial assessment of their shape. These predictions are used to initialize for gradient- and model-based optimization algorithm to further refine the estimates. We demonstrate numerically how the presented architecture performs on measurement data and analytically study its influence on the estimation of specular paths in a setting where the single-modal approach fails.},

  abstract = {The localization of defects is a prevalent task in ultrasound nondestructive testing. Multi-channel techniques like Full Matrix Capture (FMC) measurements are employed in this regard for their better spatial accuracy compared to single-channel synthetic aperture measurements at the expense of larger data volumes and increased measurement time. In this paper, we analyze a compressed sensing scenario in which location parameters of point-like scatterers are estimated from subsampled FMC data. Particularly, the impact of the specific choice of Tx and Rx elements is studied by means of the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB). We derive the CRB of lateral and vertical position of the scatterers estimated from FMC data, as well as expressions for the CRB that arise in the far-field scenario. These expressions are useful for two reasons. First, they provide insights about the impact of number and location of channels on the localization performance. Second, we can use them to optimize the sensor positions in the subsampled array, which we demonstrate by introducing a CRB-based array design technique. The far-field expressions reveal that only two channels are required for the CRB of the lateral case to become finite, and also indicate a far-field gain when using a larger subsampled array.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound Computed Tomography (UCT) is challenging due to phenomena such as strong refraction, multiple scattering, and mode conversion. In NDT, large speed of sound contrasts lead to strong artifacts if such phenomena are not modeled correctly; however, enhanced models are computationally expensive. In this work, a two-step framework for Compressed UCT based on the integral approach to the solution of the Helmholtz equation is presented. It comprises a physically motivated forward step and an imaging step that solves a suitable inverse problem. Multiple scattering is accounted for through the use of Neumann series. Convergence problems of Neumann series in high contrast settings are addressed via Padé approximants. Compressed sensing is employed to reduce the computational complexity of the reconstruction procedure by reducing data volumes directly at the measurement step, avoiding redundancy in the data and allowing the ability to steer the admissible computational effort at the expense of reconstruction quality. The proposed method is shown to yield high quality reconstructions under heavy subsampling in the frequency and spatial domains.},

However, due to the matrix-free implementation, additional steps are necessary to estimate the stepsize parameter required by FISTA, since the optimal stepsize depends on the largest singular value of the operator matrix, which in the matrix-free version is unavailable and cannot be built due to its size. The estimation is performed based on a priori knowledge of the model.

To this end, we give a rigorous derivation of an iterative scheme called alternating direction of multipliers method, which is able to incorporate multiple compressive snapshots from a multi-dimensional superposition of complex harmonics. The key result here is how to formulate the objective function minimized by this scheme and its partial derivatives, which become hard to manage if the dimensionality of the frequencies is larger than 1.

By utilizing compressive sensing, such arrays employ a linear combining network to combine signals from a larger set of antenna elements in the analog RF domain. In this paper, we develop a design approach based on the minimization of error between spatial correlation function (SCF) of the compressive and the uncompressed array resulting in the estimation performance of the two arrays to be as close as possible. The proposed design is based on grid-free stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization.

A compressive spatial channel sounder is proposed and evaluated based on real scenarios showing advantages in terms of time, hardware complexity and resolution. In particular, in the case where we use time division duplex for measuring the MIMO channel (in the form of antenna switching at the transmitter and/or the receiver), the proposed approach reduces the total number of switching periods, which implies a reduced channel acquisition time and thus an improved Doppler bandwidth. Alternatively, if we use multiple receive RF chains for the measurement, the compression allows to reduce the number of RF chains, which is a relevant advantage in terms of the overall receiver complexity, the amount of data to be processed in the digital domain (e.g., FPGA), power consumption, as well as RF hardware calibration. On the other hand, for the same measurement time and/or hardware complexity, one can increase the number of array elements to cover a larger aperture and so achieving better performance in terms of resolution.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient matrix-free algorithm to reconstruct locations and size of flaws in a specimen from volumetric ultrasound data by means of a native 3D Sparse Signal Recovery scheme using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The efficiency of the proposed approach is achieved in two ways. First, we formulate the dictionary matrix as a block multilevel Toeplitz matrix to minimize redundancy and thus memory consumption. Second, we exploit this specific structure in the dictionary to speed up the correlation step in OMP, which is implemented matrix-free. We compare our method to state-of-the-art, namely 3D Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique, and show that it delivers a visually comparable performance, while it gains the additional freedom to use further methods such as Compressed Sensing.},

  abstract = {In ultrasound nondestructive testing (NDT), a widespread approach is to take synthetic aperture measurements from the surface of a specimen to detect and locate defects within it. Based on these measurements, imaging is usually performed using the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT). However, SAFT is suboptimal in terms of resolution and requires oversampling in the time domain to obtain a fine grid for the delay-and-sum (DAS). On the other hand, parametric reconstruction algorithms give better resolution, but their usage for imaging becomes computationally expensive due to the size of the parameter space and a large amount of measurement data in realistic 3-D scenarios when using oversampling. In the literature, the remedies to this are twofold. First, the amount of measurement data can be reduced using state-of-the-art sub-Nyquist sampling approaches to measure Fourier coefficients instead of time-domain samples. Second, parametric reconstruction algorithms mostly rely on matrix–vector operations that can be implemented efficiently by exploiting the underlying structure of the model. In this article, we propose and compare different strategies to choose the Fourier coefficients to be measured. Their asymptotic performance is compared by numerically evaluating the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) for the localizability of the defect coordinates. These subsampling strategies are then combined with an l1 -minimization scheme to compute 3-D reconstructions from the low-rate measurements. Compared to conventional DAS, this allows us to formulate a fully physically motivated forward model matrix. To enable this, the projection operations of the forward model matrix are implemented matrix-free by exploiting the underlying two-level Toeplitz structure. Finally, we show that high-resolution reconstructions from as low as a single Fourier coefficient per A-scan are possible based on simulated data and measurements from a steel specimen.},

  abstract = 	{Along with the ever increasing number of sensors, which are also generating rapidly growing amounts of data, the traditional paradigm of sampling adhering the Nyquist criterion is facing an equally increasing number of obstacles. The rather recent theory of Compressive Sensing (CS) promises to alleviate some of these drawbacks by proposing to generalize the sampling and reconstruction schemes such that the acquired samples can contain more complex information about the signal than Nyquist samples. The proposed measurement process is more complex and the reconstruction algorithms necessarily need to be nonlinear. Additionally, the hardware design process needs to be revisited as well in order to account for this new acquisition scheme. Hence, one can identify a trade-off between information that is contained in individual samples of a signal and effort during development and operation of the sensing system. This thesis addresses the necessary steps to shift the mentioned trade-off more to the favor of CS. We do so by providing new results that make CS easier to deploy in practice while also maintaining the performance indicated by theoretical results. The sparsity order of a signal plays a central role in any CS system. Hence, we present a method to estimate this crucial quantity prior to recovery from a single snapshot. As we show, this proposed Sparsity Order Estimation method allows to improve the reconstruction error compared to an unguided reconstruction. During the development of the theory we notice that the matrix-free view on the involved linear mappings offers a lot of possibilities to render the reconstruction and modeling stage much more efficient. Hence, we present an open source software architecture to construct these matrix-free representations and showcase its ease of use and performance when used for sparse recovery to detect defects from ultrasound data as well as estimating scatterers in a radio channel using ultra-wideband impulse responses. For the former of these two applications, we present a complete reconstruction pipeline when the ultrasound data is compressed by means of sub-sampling in the frequency domain. Here, we present the algorithms for the forward model, the reconstruction stage and we give asymptotic bounds for the number of measurements and the expected reconstruction error. We show that our proposed system allows significant compression levels without substantially deteriorating the imaging quality. For the second application, we develop a sampling scheme to acquire the channel Impulse Response (IR) based on a Random Demodulator that allows to capture enough information in the recorded samples to reliably estimate the IR when exploiting sparsity. Compared to the state of the art, this in turn allows to improve the robustness to the effects of time-variant radar channels while also outperforming state of the art methods based on Nyquist sampling in terms of reconstruction error. In order to circumvent the inherent model mismatch of early grid-based compressive sensing theory, we make use of the Atomic Norm Minimization framework and show how it can be used for the estimation of the signal covariance with R-dimensional parameters from multiple compressive snapshots. To this end, we derive a variant of the ADMM that can estimate this covariance in a very general setting and we show how to use this for direction finding with realistic antenna geometries. In this context we also present a method based on a Stochastic gradient descent iteration scheme to find compression schemes that are well suited for parameter estimation, since the resulting sub-sampling has a uniform effect on the whole parameter space. Finally, we show numerically that the combination of these two approaches yields a well performing grid-free CS pipeline.},

Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB{\texttrademark}, Mathematica{\texttrademark}, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability.
